Used Car Price Analysis
Overview
In today's technologically advanced world, data analysis is crucial for ensuring the accuracy and reliability of machine learning models. This project focuses on analyzing the selling prices of used cars to extract meaningful insights from raw data. Proper data analysis is essential for making informed decisions, as poorly organized data can lead to inaccurate models and potential financial losses.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains various attributes of used cars, including price, color, brand, horsepower, and more. Our goal is to analyze this data to help our friend, Otis, determine a reasonable selling price for his car while maximizing profit.

Problem Statement
Otis wants to sell his car but is unsure of the appropriate price. As data scientists, our task is to assist him by answering the following questions:
What features of cars most affect their selling prices?
Does the color, brand, or horsepower influence the price?
What insights can we gain from the data to make an informed pricing decision?
Approach
Data Collection: Gather data on used cars, including their various attributes.
Data Cleaning: Organize and clean the raw data to ensure accuracy.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze the data to identify patterns and relationships between car features and their prices.
